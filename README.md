# Computational-Physics
Collection of some codes written during the internship days at Bhaba Atomic Research Center. We have used [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) for computational purposes. I have written lots of programs, here are some of them.

#### Blotted square well Fermi-type potential
We worked on the potential of type $$V(e)=u_0\cdot \frac{1}{(1+e^{-r/a})}$$, here e is energy, r can be interpretted as radius of
nucleus and a is the charge density. It's under peer review process for publication in American Physical Society. The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02284)

* [Half bound states in Fermi-type potential](https://github.com/t-gos7/Computational-Physics/blob/master/Fermi-half-bound-state.nb)
* [Wave functions in Fermi-type potential](https://github.com/t-gos7/Computational-Physics/blob/master/FermiPotential-GaussHyperGeometricFunc.nb)
